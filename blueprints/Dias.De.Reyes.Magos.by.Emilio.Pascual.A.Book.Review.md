## The Plot
 
The protagonist of Dias De Reyes Magos is an unnamed boy who has lost interest in his school and family life. He spends his days wandering around the city, stealing, begging, and getting into trouble. He has no friends, no dreams, no goals. He feels empty and hopeless.
 
One day, he meets a blind man who offers him a job as a reader. The blind man is a former professor of literature who lost his sight in an accident. He lives alone in a small apartment filled with books. He pays the boy to read him books from his collection, ranging from classics to contemporary novels.
 
The boy accepts the job out of curiosity and boredom, but soon he discovers the magic of reading. He becomes fascinated by the stories, the characters, the words, and the emotions that books evoke. He learns about history, culture, art, philosophy, and life. He also develops a friendship with the blind man, who becomes his mentor and guide.
