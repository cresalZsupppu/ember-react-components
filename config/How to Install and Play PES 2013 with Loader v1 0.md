## How to Master the Moves and Skills in PES 2013
 
PES 2013 is not only about scoring goals and winning matches. It is also about showing off your skills and tricks on the pitch. PES 2013 has a variety of moves and skills that you can use to dribble past defenders, create space, and surprise your opponents. However, you need to master the controls and timing of these moves and skills to use them effectively.
 
In this section, we will show you some of the most useful and impressive moves and skills in PES 2013, and how to perform them with ease. We will also give you some tips and tricks on when and where to use them.
 
### Double Touch
 
Double Touch is a newly introduced move in PES 13. It allows you to quickly change direction and speed with a double tap of the right analog stick. You can use it to evade tackles, cut inside, or switch flanks. To perform it, you need to flick the right analog stick twice in the direction you want to go. The first flick will make your player touch the ball slightly forward, and the second flick will make him accelerate with a sharp turn.
 
Tip: You can use Double Touch when you are running with the ball on the wing, and you want to cut inside towards the goal. You can also use it when you are facing a defender head-on, and you want to dribble past him with a sudden change of direction.
 
### Controlled First Touch
 
PES 13 is not an easy game. You need to have good control over the ball, especially when you receive a pass or a cross. Controlled First Touch is a skill that allows you to trap the ball with precision and finesse. You can use it to set up your next move, whether it is a shot, a pass, or a dribble. To perform it, you need to hold R2/RT when you receive the ball. This will make your player cushion the ball with his foot, chest, or head, depending on the height and speed of the ball.
 
Tip: You can use Controlled First Touch when you receive a long pass or a cross in the box, and you want to take a shot or a volley without losing balance or accuracy. You can also use it when you receive a short pass in a tight space, and you want to keep the ball close to your feet.
 
### Manual Passing
 
PES 13 has introduced an arrow on the field when manually passing. This arrow shows you the direction and power of your pass, and it helps you to make more accurate and creative passes. You can use Manual Passing to find gaps in the defense, switch play, or play one-twos. To perform it, you need to hold L1/LB when passing. This will activate the arrow on the field, which you can adjust with the left analog stick. The longer you hold the pass button, the more power you will put into your pass.
 
Tip: You can use Manual Passing when you want to play a through ball behind the defense, or when you want to play a cross-field pass to switch flanks. You can also use it when you want to play a one-two with a teammate, by aiming the arrow at him and then at yourself.
 
### Shooting at the Accurate Direction
 
PES 13 has improved the shooting mechanics and animations, making it more realistic and satisfying. However, shooting at the accurate direction is not easy. You need to consider factors such as your player's position, angle, balance, foot preference, and pressure from defenders. You also need to adjust your aim and power according to these factors. To perform it, you need to hold L2/LT when shooting. This will allow you to shoot at the exact direction you want, by using the left analog stick.
 
Tip: You can use Shooting at the Accurate Direction when you have a clear sight of goal, or when you want to curl or bend your shot around the keeper or defenders. You can also use it when you want to chip or lob your shot over the keeper or defenders.
 
## Conclusion
 
PES 2013 is a game that rewards skillful and creative players who can master the moves and skills in the game. By
