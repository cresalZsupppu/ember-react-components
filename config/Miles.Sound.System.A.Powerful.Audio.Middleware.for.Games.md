# Miles Sound System: A Powerful Audio Middleware for Games
 
Miles Sound System is a software development kit (SDK) and library that provides high-level sound authoring and playback for games and multimedia applications. It supports 2D and 3D digital audio, streaming, environmental and convolution reverb, multistage DSP filtering, multichannel mixing, and highly-optimized audio decoders (MP3, Ogg and Bink Audio). Miles Sound System has been licensed for over 7,200 games on 18 different platforms, making it one of the most popular pieces of middleware ever released[^1^].

Miles Sound System was originally developed by John Miles in the early 1990s as the Audio Interface Library (AIL), a sound middleware system that abstracted the hardware-specific details of various sound cards through a single unified API[^2^]. Over the years, Miles Sound System has evolved to include a comprehensive toolset called Miles Studio, which allows sound designers to work on their own assets without generating conflicts with anyone else, and to modify, add, or remove anything in their project instantly while the game is running. Miles Studio also provides complete control over compression levels, mixing, busing, localization, spatialization, routing, DSP, and game parameterization[^1^].
 
Miles Sound System is designed to be scalable, performant, powerful, and iterative. It can handle projects of any size, from simple sound effects to complex soundscapes with tens of thousands of audio sources and events. It blends a cache-friendly mixing architecture with processor efficient algorithms to get the most out of every platform. And it works with teams of any size, allowing for easy diffs and multiple audio engineers working simultaneously. Miles Sound System is the most sophisticated, most robust, and most fully featured sound system available for your games[^1^].

In this section, we will explore some of the features and benefits of Miles Sound System in more detail.
 
## 2D and 3D Digital Audio
 
Miles Sound System supports both 2D and 3D digital audio, allowing you to create immersive and realistic sound environments for your games. You can use Miles to play back mono, stereo, or multichannel sounds, and to spatialize them according to their position, orientation, velocity, and distance from the listener. You can also use Miles to apply environmental effects such as reverb, occlusion, obstruction, and Doppler shift to your sounds, simulating the acoustic properties of different spaces and objects. Miles supports various 3D audio standards and APIs, such as OpenAL, DirectSound3D, XAudio2, and Dolby Atmos.
 
## Streaming and Compression
 
Miles Sound System supports streaming audio from disk or memory, allowing you to play back large sound files without loading them entirely into memory. This reduces the memory footprint and loading times of your game, and enables you to use high-quality sounds without compromising performance. Miles also supports various compression formats and codecs for your sounds, such as MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Bink Audio, ADPCM, XMA, and more. You can choose the compression level and quality for each sound file or group of files, balancing the trade-off between size and fidelity. Miles also provides a seamless looping feature for compressed sounds, eliminating any gaps or clicks at the loop points.
 
## Multistage DSP Filtering and Multichannel Mixing
 
Miles Sound System allows you to apply various DSP effects and filters to your sounds, such as equalization, low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, flange, chorus, distortion, echo, delay, pitch shift, volume envelope, and more. You can apply these effects globally or individually to each sound source or channel. You can also create custom DSP effects using the Miles DSP API or the Miles Studio DSP editor. Miles also supports multichannel mixing for your sounds, allowing you to route them to different speakers or outputs. You can create custom mixing matrices and busses for your sounds, and control the volume, pan, mute, solo, and send levels for each channel or bus.
