If you have multiple audio devices connected to your computer, such as speakers, headphones, microphones, or TVs, you may have encountered some problems with managing the sound output of different applications.

But how can you do that without messing up the default settings of your Windows audio mixer?
 
That's where CheVolume comes in handy. CheVolume is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that lets you control the audio output of any application on your computer. You can assign different audio devices to different applications, and switch them anytime you want with a simple click.

CheVolume works with any audio device and any application that emits sound, including web browsers, media players, games, voice chat programs, and more.

You can also right-click on the icon to access some quick options, such as opening the settings menu or exiting the program.
